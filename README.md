# Website-v2

My new little website (RIP catfoolyou.github.io)

It now has all of the games in one place, so that it can be redeployed without a pain in the ass if it gets blocked like the original site, go look around my repos on Github if you like.

I was too lazy to make something decent so I slapped this together in less than a minute. No CSS or anything because I'm lazy.

## Quick fork instructions
1) Fork this repo
2) Go to Settings > Pages
3) Set the "branch" to "main"
4) Hit save
5) It should pop up under "deployments" on the main page
